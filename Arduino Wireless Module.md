# How Wireless Modules Function

## Outline:
Examining how the component operates in further depth.

## Component:
nRF24L01+ is a transceiver module that transfer data, allowing comunicatoin between similar trandceiver module. As seen below of the image of the module with the addition of an antenna attachment.

## Overview:
The design of the nRF24L01+ enables transmission of data through radio frequency. Which the radio frequency operates in 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band along with using a GFSK moduleation to transfer data.

The 2.4 GHz ISM band is reseved for the use unlisensed low-powered devices. As this 2.4 GHz band is one of Industrial,
